## 1. Project Overview & Value

**Traffic Signboard Instructor** is a full-stack AI-powered web application for recognizing and teaching traffic signs using image classification. Users can upload images, receive instant feedback, view sign details, and track their learning. The platform is scalable for education, driving schools, and smart city integrations.

## 3. Detailed Roadmap & Milestones

### **Phase 1: Foundation**
- Set up Django project (`traffic/`)
- Configure static & media files
- Create initial templates (`index.html`, `home.html`)
- Build user registration, login, logout (Django Auth)

### **Phase 2: Core Functionality**
- Train and export ML model for sign classification (Keras, CNN)
- Integrate model prediction into Django (views, forms)
- Build image upload form & processing pipeline
- Display prediction results and sign details

### **Phase 3: User Experience**
- Implement dark/light theme toggle
- Add animated banner (main_image.jpg) and “Why Us”/About sections
- Design responsive UI (Flexbox, media queries)
- Add traffic rules, info, and educational content

### **Phase 4: Admin & Analytics**
- Set up Django Admin for user and prediction management
- Create dashboard for site stats (user count, sign count, usage)
- Implement user history logs


---

## 5. Professional Architecture Design

### **A. Modular Codebase**
- `traffic/`: Django configuration and URLs
- `templates/`: All HTML templates for pages and components
- `static/`: CSS, JS, images, ML model files
- `model/`: ML weights and scripts
- `users/`: Custom user logic (if needed)

### **B. Security & Best Practices**
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Restrict file types for uploads (JPEG, PNG only)
- Limit upload size (<10MB)
- Enforce HTTPS in production
- Regularly update dependencies

### **C. Scalability & Extensibility**
- Modularize code for easy feature addition
- Abstract prediction logic for future models
- Provide REST API for mobile/smart integrations

### **D. UX/UI Excellence**
- Use modern fonts, colors, and animations
- Accessibility: alt texts, color contrast, keyboard navigation
- Animated banner and interactive sections

## 6. Example Workflow

1. **User Registration/Login**
2. **Image Upload** (`home.html`)
3. **Prediction** (Django view runs Keras model → Result)
4. **Result Display** (Sign name, info, stats)
5. **Admin Management** (monitor users, predictions)

---

## 7. Adding and Aligning the Banner

- Place banner at top (see `templates/index.html`)
- Use CSS flexbox for centering and responsiveness:
  ```css
  .centered-image {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
    width: 80%;
    border-radius: 10px;
    animation: zoomIn 2s ease-out;
  }
  ```
- Ensure image is referenced via Django static:
  ```html
  <img src="{% static 'images/main_image.jpg' %}" alt="Traffic Signs" class="centered-image">
  ```

## 8. Tips for Professional Delivery

- Document code and keep README up to date.
- Use GitHub Issues/Projects for tracking progress.
- Invite collaboration through clear contribution guidelines.
- Showcase results and stats on the main page.
